Modify the root command's Action in main.go. When an unknown subcommand is invoked (e.g., \"hb some-future-bd-command\"), instead of showing \"unknown command\" error:\n   - Check if the first arg looks like a bd subcommand (not a flag, not \"account\")\n   - Call requireAuth() for the session\n   - Forward all args to runBd with assignee injection\n   - This ensures future bd commands work with hb without needing hb code changes\n\n2. Implementation approach: In buildApp(), set the root command's Action to a function that:\n   - If no args (just \"hb\"), show help\n   - If first arg starts with \"-\", show help (it's a flag)\n   - Otherwise, treat args as a bd command: auth check → runBd(ctx, os.Args[1:]) with rewriting\n   - Use cmd.Args().Slice() to get unrecognized args\n\n3.
